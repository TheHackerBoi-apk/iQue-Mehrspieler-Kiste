## iQue Multiplayer Box replacement
### Why is this even a thing?
Over the years getting the iQue Multiplayer (MP)  "Family Package" is getting harder and harder. Therefore, most iQue MP Boxes are expensive as are the specific controllers for it. This project aims to replace the MP box and use normal N64 jacks so the special controllers aren't needed.  
Additionally the iQue Player natively has S-Video but it isn't made available with the normal cable or the MP box. This project makes this signal available and easy to use so you can enjoy the increased video quality. Note that composite video is also still supported.
